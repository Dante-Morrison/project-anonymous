Everything that is currently in progress can be found in the Projects tab on Github. 

# Before you start the project
* remember to have Unity Version 2021.1.15f1 installed. the project will not work otherwise.

* dont commit any large files. instead, just upload them to google drive or something and let people know where its supposed to go
